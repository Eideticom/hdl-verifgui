# Design Hierarchy Viewer

This tab is simply a convenience tab so you can see the simple tree structure
of your design. It uses the output from the parser, so the Parse task must be
run before you will be able to see anything.

Click on the arrows to the left of a module name to expand it and see the
modules it instantiates. Right-clicking a module also allows you to copy the
hierarchical path of the module, for easy use in debugging and testbenches.

To the right, some basic information about the module is displayed in a text
box.
